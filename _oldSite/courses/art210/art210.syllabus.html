        <h5>summary</h5>
        <p>This is a studio course first and foremost.  In keeping with the tradition of a studio arts course, the focus on the classroom experience will be on art, design, and image making.  We will also be looking at works, trends and themes present within contemporary art and design practices by way of presentations, readings, and class discussion.</p>
        <p>Our time together in class is formatted as a combination of seminar and tutorial / lecture.  Class sessions can include presentations, tutorials, discussion, critique, and production time</p>

        <h5>background</h5>
      <p>As you will likely realize throughout this course, much of the language and tradition to be found in other mediums of creative production / research are relatively settled when compared to those of New Media and Digital Art. Even the term "Digital Art" is problematic as it does not accurately depict or describe the practices, products, artifacts, artists, and designers that will be observed this semester.  </p>
      <blockquote class="tab">
        <q><em>
          Digital media art has been practiced and theorized within frameworks of more traditional media, such as television, avant-garde art, and fluxus art. However, the udneerstanding of what is radically new about digital media often eludes such frameworks, because digital media challenges many of the paradigms which these frameworks are built upon. The need for an original framework which emerges from digital media is imperative for a new medium.
      </q></em>

      <p class="tab">-- excerpt from Thesis statement in DXARTS 201 syllabus, DXARTS Program, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.</p>
      <p>The medium in question for this course is better defined loosely by the terms "flux" or "emerging" in that it is constantly evolving.  If there are roots, they are bonded to the first transmission of signal over distance.  It is important to note that, in this way, smoke signals are related to Morse code, and on, and on...</p>

        <h5>goals</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Understanding of Core Creative Coding Concepts:</b> Ensure students grasp the fundamentals of "coding", including variables, loops, conditionals, data structures, and functions.  This understanding should be applicable across a range of programming languages, though the course will focus on languages expecially relevant to an introduction to creative coding and new media art, such as Processing or the Javascript library P5.js</li>
          <li><b>Exploration of New Media Art History and Theory:</b> Familiarize students with the evolution of new media art (also occassionally known as Digital Art), important artists and works in the field, and current trends.  Students will be introduced to critical theory related to new media and digital art, exploring concepts like interactivity, virtuality, and the relationship between technology and culture.</li>
          <li><b>Proficiency in Creative Technology Tools and Processes:</b> Develop practical skills in using various software, languages, and platforms that are often used in new media art and design creation.  This will include graphic programming environments, version and cloud storage management, editors, browsers, etc.</li>
          <li><b>Expansion of Creative Realization:</b> Students will incorporate there new coding skills into their creative practice for the semester.  They will focus on Creative Coding as not only a means to an end, but as a medium itself.  This will involve understanding the aesthetic capabilities of various practices.</li>
          <li><b>Development and Execution of New Media Arts Projects:</b> Students will learn to plan, execute, and critique their own new media projects.  This objective will culminate in a final project that brings together the coding skills, aesthetic understanding, and creative practices that the course has explored.</li>
          <li><b>Critical Evaluation and Discussion:</b> Cultivate a learning environment where students are encouraged to critically evaluate their own works and those of their peers.  This should culminate in students developing their capacity to articulate thoughts on aesthetics, function, and meaning in new media arts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>community expectations</h5>
        <p>Works of art and expression can be of a personal or even controversial nature at times.  Please respect your colleagues and give their work your best attention.  If you disagree with a work or its content, remember that when engaging others' work you must be a responsible and professional critic, and as such must work to make your criticism constructive and descriptive.  Speak in this class with the expectation of being heard, and listen carefully because there are always opportunities to grow.  The following are expected as qualties of engagement with this class community:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>love of truth</b> - Love of truth is an intellectual virtue because its absence has serious moral consequences.  Relativism chips away at our fundamental respect for one another as human beings.  Once truth becomes suspect, debates become little more than efforts at manipulation.</li>
          <li><b>honesty</b> - Honesty enables students to face the limits of what they themselves know; it encourages them to explore their own mistakes.</li>
          <li><b>fair-mindedness</b> - Students need to be fair-minded in evaluating the arguments of others and to be aware of their own biases.</li>
          <li><b>humility</b> - Humility allows students to embrace their own limitations and mistakes and to pursue knowledge and assistance from a multitude of resources.</li>
          <li><b>preseverance</b> -  Little that is worth knowing or doing will come easily... and be critical of that which does.</li>
          <li><b>courage</b> - Intellectual courage is necessary to stand up for what students know is true and to be able to take risks.</li>
          <li><b>good listening</b> - Good learning can not take place in the absence of good listening.  Good listening takes courage, as it means your own views on the world, along with your plans on how to live in it, can be challenged when good conversation is created.</li>
          <li><b>perspective-taking and empathy</b> - You must be able to put yourself in the shoes of someone else and identify with their unique situation... or at least be willing to do the work to approach this.  These skills pay enourmous dividends in professional and personal life.</li>
          <li><b>wisdom</b> - Any virtue, no matter how objectively "good", can be carried to an extreme.  Wisdom enables us to find the balance between timidity and recklessness, carelessness and obsessiveness, flightiness and stubbornness, speaking up and listening up, trust and skepticism, empathy and detachment.  Being empathetic, fair, and open-minded often rubs up against fidelity to the truth.  Practical wisdom is the guide in this journey.</li>

        <h5>attendance</h5>
        <p>Attendance credit for this course will be generated through the scheduled meeting times with the faculty member.  These scheduled meetings may be in person, digital, or a combination of both. It is also expected that the students will have a rigorous, individual work schedule that will support ample productivity throughout the semester.  Setting a consistent work schedule with ample dedicated time to research and practice is expected. As life can and does certainly happen, you should notify the faculty member if anything will keep you from making a scheduled appointment as soon as you know of the conflict.  Reasonable accommodations will be made in the following instances suggested by MSU’s attendance policy: 1) participation in University-sanctioned activities and programs; 2) personal illness; or 3) family and/or other compelling circumstances.</p>

        <h5>late work</h5>
        <p>I do not accept late work for this course (see Cult of Done).  If a project is not turned in on the due date, the student will receive a zero for that assignment / project.  Turn in what you have, even if you consider it "unfinished".  If you are unsatisfied with the product you turn in, you may lobby for a due date extension based on the circumstances that forced you into that situation.  Again, you must have something turned in on the due date to be able to negotiate this extension.</p>

        <h5>university / department policies</h5>
        <p><b>Art + Design Department</b> | Academic Integrity Statement</p>
        <p>University policy: Missouri State University is a community of scholars committed to developing educated persons who accept the responsibility to practice personal and academic integrity. You are responsible for knowing and following the university’s honor code, Student Academic Integrity Policies and Procedures are available at http://www.missouristate.edu/policy/academicintegritystudents.htm and the Reserves Desk in Meyer Library.</p>
         <p>The Department of Art and Design supplemental policy: Any student participating in any form of academic dishonesty -- including but not limited to the submission of text or images (still and moving, digital or physical) that are not a student’s individual academic or artistic property -- will be subject to sanctions as described in the University policy. Submitted work – both textual and visual – must be formally, materially, and creatively/intellectually the student’s own production.</p>
          <p>Particular coursework or assignments may involve the use of appropriated images or works in the public domain; in these circumstances, work that appropriates or responds to photographs, published images, incorporates artificial intelligence generated content, and/or other artists’ works must show significant and synthetic development or manipulation of the formal qualities, design, and/or concept of the source material beyond duplication. In a manner analogous to the citation of textual sources in written assignments, students should clearly acknowledge any source material used.</p>
