		G T: Selected generative typography projects between 2011 and 2014 by <a href="http://kyuhashim.com/" target="_blank" class="accent">Kyuha Shim</a>
		</span><br><br>
		<span class="blk">
			In the realm of contemporary graphic design, a convergence of computational thinking and parametric design methods has taken center stage. This dynamic fusion encompasses various aspects, ranging from the development of digital fonts to the integration of sophisticated tools and effects within software applications.<br>
			<span class="wh">
			Designers today actively engage in programming bespoke tools tailored to their specific needs, thereby transforming the computer from a mere tool into a potent medium. This medium adeptly translates the intricate logic of designers into computational systems that, in turn, automate their artistic abstractions with remarkable precision and speed. </span><br>
			<span class="wh">
			Within this context, G T emerges as an exemplar, showcasing the boundless potential of generative form-giving within typography through the adept utilization of algorithmic and real-time formations. The essence of form resides in the manipulation of parameters spanning diverse value ranges, culminating in a remarkably flexible and iterative process. As the values continually respond to incoming data, the typography evolves and adapts in a dynamic dance of creative expression. </span>

			Contemporary graphic design practices encompass computational thinking and parametric design methods from digital fonts to tools and effects built in software applications. As designers program their own tools for their needs, the computer has become more than a tool: it is a medium that translates designers' logic into computational systems that automate their abstractions.<br>
			<span class="wh">G T demonstrates possibilities of generative form-giving in typography through algorithmic and real-time formations. Form is defined by ranges of values in parameters, becoming flexible and iterative, as the changing values respond to data.--> </span>
