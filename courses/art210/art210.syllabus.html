        <h5>goals</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Understanding of Core Creative Coding Concepts:</b> Ensure students grasp the fundamentals of "coding", including variables, loops, conditionals, data structures, and functions.  This understanding should be applicable across a range of programming languages, though the course will focus on languages expecially relevant to an introduction to creative coding and new media art, such as Processing or the Javascript library P5.js</li>
          <li><b>Exploration of New Media Art History and Theory:</b> Familiarize students with the evolution of new media art (also occassionally known as Digital Art), important artists and works in the field, and current trends.  Students will be introduced to critical theory related to new media and digital art, exploring concepts like interactivity, virtuality, and the relationship between technology and culture.</li>
          <li><b>Proficiency in Creative Technology Tools and Processes:</b> Develop practical skills in using various software, languages, and platforms that are often used in new media art creation.  This will include graphic programming environments, version and cloud storage management, editors, browsers, etc.</li>
          <li><b>Expansion of Creative Realization:</b> Students will incorporate there new coding skills into their artistic practice for the semester.  They will focus on Creative Coding as not only a means to an end, but as a creative medium itself.  This will involve understanding the aesthetic capabilities of various practices.</li>
          <li><b>Development and Execution of New Media Arts Projects:</b> Students will learn to plan, execute, and critique their own new media projects.  This objective will culminate in a final project that brings together the coding skills, aesthetic understanding, and creative practices that the course has explored.</li>
          <li><b>Critical Evaluation and Discussion:</b> Cultivate a learning environment where students are encouraged to critically evaluate their own works and those of their peers.  This should culminate in students developing their capacity to articulate thoughts on aesthetics, function, and meaning in new media arts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>attendance</h5>
        <p>Attendance credit for this course will be generated through the scheduled meeting times with the faculty member.  These scheduled meetings may be in person, digital, or a combination of both. It is also expected that the students will have a rigorous, individual work schedule that will support ample productivity throughout the semester.  Setting a consistent work schedule with ample dedicated time to research and practice is expected. As life can and does certainly happen, you should notify the faculty member if anything will keep you from making a scheduled appointment as soon as you know of the conflict.  Reasonable accommodations will be made in the following instances suggested by MSU’s attendance policy: 1) participation in University-sanctioned activities and programs; 2) personal illness; or 3) family and/or other compelling circumstances.</p>
