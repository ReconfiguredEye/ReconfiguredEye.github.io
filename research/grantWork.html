**Key Terms**

**_Aesthetic experience_** – “Aesthetics is a discipline concerned with the perception, appreciation, and production of art.  Aesthetic experiences, such as looking at paintings, listening to music, or reading poems, are linked to the perception of external objects, but not to any apparent functional use the objects might have.  Aesthetic experience involves more than preference, encompassing a variety of emotional responses ranging from beauty to awe, sublimity, and a variety of other (often knowledge-based) emotions.”[[1]](#_ftn1)

**Brain Computer Interface (BCI)** – “A BCI is a computer-based system that acquires brain signals, analyzes them, and translates them into commands that are relayed to an output device to carry out a desired action.”[[2]](#_ftn2)

**EEG (Electroencephalogram)** – An EEG is a procedure that records the electrical signals of the brain via electrodes that contact the skin in key positions on the human head.  Brain activity is registered as small voltage fluctuations that occur due to the ionic current produced by neurons.  When recorded over time, these voltage fluctuations represent neural oscillations, which are commonly referred to as brain waves. 

**Human Computer Interaction (HCI)** – “Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a multidisciplinary field of study focusing on the design of computer technology and, in particular, the interaction between humans (the users) and computers.  While initially concerned with computers, HCI has since expanded to cover almost all forms of information technology design.”[[3]](#_ftn3)

**TouchDesigner** – TouchDesigner is an audiovisual development platform with a library of software tools pre-built that aid in creating or manipulating imagery and audio in real-time.  This software is widely used in creating interactive media systems, architectural projections, live music visuals, augmented reality and virtual reality experiences.  TouchDesigner is effective for prototyping and final production.[[4]](#_ftn4)

**Project Summary**


This research project will explore the potential in existing non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCI) to weave real-time data into a multi-sensory aesthetic experience. Using a wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) to trace the intricate dance of neural activity, participants will be presented with a virtual projected forest that moves and grows in response to provided brainwave data.  By linking the participants provided streams of data to the movement and growth of a natural, albeit virtual, system, this project seeks to manifest the complexity of human cognition and emotion within an immersive experience that causes reflection on the ripple impact of even the smallest actions. It builds upon the rich fields of immersive art, virtual reality, data visualization, and creative coding, resonating with the human impulse for connection that echoes through the intersection of art and technology.

Reflecting the characteristic tension of the contemporary moment, this project recognizes the individualized nature of aesthetic experiences as well as the complex nature of external influences on those experiences. Instead of a pre-determination or control, the goal is a dynamic interplay where imagery and sound ebb and flow with the participants' brainwaves in real time. A call to awareness and intentionality, creating a canvas that lives with the participants.

This project will contribute to expanding the conventional boundaries in human-computer interaction, venturing to connect directly with audience experience, and building a dialogue between the locus of an aesthetic experience - the mind-, the artwork, and the community whose participation was critical to its creation. It's an opportunity to celebrate shared humanity and to rediscover connection in an increasingly fragmented world. 


**Purpose of the project**

**A**. _A statement of the problem._

Aesthetic experience presents as a seeming paradox. An uniquely individual experience that is highly subject to outside influence reflects the interconnected complexity that characterizes nature, society, and human consciousness. The recent declaration of a new Anthropocene Epoch characterized by the human influence on climate is a prime example of the emerging importance of understanding complex systems and the influences they have (or may have) on one another.  This project forces new perspective by artificially collapsing the space between human cognition and the natural systems of a forest, as well as between neural activity and computer generated imagery.

From the 1950s to today, artists have shifted towards collaboration and co-production, transforming art into a dynamic exchange that reflects a more contemporary human experience. The impulse to unite more directly with audience participation has ancient roots, now resurfacing in an era where technology enables new and profound connection.  

Human-computer interaction provides a gateway to exploring this intricate web.  Interfaces and sensors allow for responses to a myriad of data streams.  However, tools like the computer mouse, while convenient, limit the possible kinds and amounts of data, favoring universal accessibility at the cost of depth and engagement.  

This research project aims to push back against these limitations by investigating the potential of EEG brain computer interface wearables in the creation of an aesthetic experience.  The focus is on creating individualized experiences in response to real-time brain-wave data.  The envisioned results is a fusion of imagery and sound in physical installations of projected virtual landscapes dynamically resonating with participants' brain-wave activity.  The motivating objective is to craft unique aesthetic experiences that inspire fascination in the complexity of cognition, reflect interconnectedness of systems, and give voice to the nuanced experience if living in our current moment in time.

**A. A statement of the problem.**

Aesthetic experience presents as a seeming paradox: an uniquely internal and individual sensation that is highly subject to outside influence. This reflects the interconnected complexity that characterizes nature, society, and human consciousness. The very threads connecting such complicated systems has become a rich area of research interest.  This theme of interconnected complexity will continue to gain prominence in the current Anthropocene Epoch marked by human attempts to grapple with the realities of our actions on natural systems.

From the 1950s to today, artists have shifted towards collaboration and co-production, transforming art into a dynamic exchange that mirrors our multifaceted human experience. This impulse to unite more directly with audience participation has ancient roots but resurfaces powerfully in an era where technology enables new and profound connection.

Human-computer interaction provides a gateway to exploring this intricate web of relationships. Interfaces and sensors allow for responses to a myriad of data streams. However, tools like the computer mouse, while convenient, limit the possible kinds and amounts of data, favoring universal accessibility at the cost of depth and engagement.

This research project aims to push back against these limitations by investigating the potential of EEG brain computer interface wearables in the creation of an aesthetic experience. By harnessing the nuanced data captured through EEG technology, the focus is on creating individualized experiences in response to real-time brain-wave data. The envisioned result is a fusion of imagery and sound in physical installations of projected virtual landscapes, dynamically resonating with participants' brain-wave activity. This innovative approach transcends traditional interfaces, opening up new dimensions of engagement.

The motivating objective is to craft unique aesthetic experiences that inspire fascination in the complexity of cognition, reflect the interconnectedness of systems, and give voice to the nuanced experience of living in our current moment in time. Through this ambitious exploration, the project seeks to connect art, technology, and consciousness in a way that resonates with our increasingly complex world, reflecting both historical trends in artistic collaboration and the challenges and opportunities of our Anthropocene age.

**B.** _Significance of the research or creative work to the academic discipline._

Visual culture and emerging technology are tightly interwoven
.  There are many examples of artists adopting, or even developing, new technologies in order to more fully engage their audience in their pursuit to connect and communicate.  This is becoming true of EEG gathered brain-wave data, as seen in experimental “mind control” game development where simple tasks are created to respond to varying levels of neural activity, as well as BCI controlled robots and drones.[[6]](#_ftn6)  Because of existing work in this field, this research project will have a potentially large, existing audience in the form of researchers, conferences, and festivals devoted to supporting such work.  This research will help create new awareness of our curricular programs at Missouri State University as well as further emphasize the creative potential of technology for our student body. 

**C.** _Objectives of the proposal (specifically what is proposed to be achieved if project is funded.)_

The objectives for this research project are listed below:

1.    The first objective is to prototype and fully develop the interactive experience that responds in real-time to a viewer/participant’s neural activity monitored by a wearable EEG device.  The project will be created to be experienced as a projected installation but will have the potential for further development as augmented or virtual reality. 

2.    A case study of the project will be developed as a research presentation to be submitted to festivals and conferences, such as the International Symposium on Electronic Arts (ISEA), the Ars Electronica Festival, and others, which are listed in the proposal below. 

3.    The final piece will be submitted for exhibition in local, regional, national and international festivals, new media events, and exhibition spaces.


**D**. _A brief outline of existing work in the field (including appropriate references) and a description of how the proposal is related to previously published work._

The current presence of EEG derived data in creative research typically utilizes pre-recorded data.  This allows for patterns to be thoroughly investigated, but minimizes, or even eliminates, the proximity and collaborative potential between artist and participant audience.  Creating a real-time loop relationship is a democratizing act, facilitating a collaboration with an audience to craft a unique version of an aesthetic experience that is generated, in part, by brainwave data.  

This project will exist in the interdisciplinary space between art and science by creating a real-time loop relationship between the viewer/participant and the aesthetic experience itself. This will affect an experience born of, and almost simultaneously received by, the brain in a loop of cause and effect.  Development of this project has drawn from a variety of research sources, including visual, perception, cognitive science, and neuroscience research.  Some of the researchers working across this field of inquiry are listed below.

_1._    _Artists employing EEG or BCI technology_

**Lia Chavez** – Lia Chavez is an important visual researcher working with EEG and BCI technology- creating opportunities for brainwaves of participants to be translated into vibrations that create sound and light[[7]](#_ftn7). This artist’s work, and the reception to their work, provides inspiration and illustrates the potential in EEG BCI technology in the making of art. 

**Luciana Haill** - Luciana Haill’s experience with viral meningitis inspired her to study the brain and use EEG data as a creative medium. [[8]](#_ftn8)  Their work in art and brain wave data has been shared globally in lectures and exhibitions.  Their work provides inspiration and a potential model for success in the intersection of art and EEG BCI technology. 

**Jess Rowland** – Sound Artist, musician, researcher, and 2018-20 Princeton Arts Fellow, Rowland has taught at UC Berkley and the School of Visual Arts in New York.  Their work “…explores the relationship between technologies and popular culture, continually aiming to reconcile the world of art and the world of science.”[[9]](#_ftn9)  Rowland has exhibited or spoken on their work at Princeton, the New York City College of Technology, Dartmouth College, Columbia University, the New York Electronic Art Festival, and Berkley.  Their work is both technically and conceptually driven by the relationships between humans and technology, which speaks directly to the motivations behind this research proposal. [[10]](#_ftn10)  

_2._    _Relevant research(ers) involving the Arts and Neuroscience_

**Giorgio Careri** – An Italian physicist, proposed that “...deep analogies are displayed between the working processes of experimental scientists and visual artists, craftspersons who detect new fragments of reality through the perception of their own data…” in their article, “Discovering by Perceiving in Art and Science”.[[11]](#_ftn11)  This article and the response to it add credibility to pursuits at the intersection of art and science. 

**Patrick Cavanagh** – A researcher and academic, Cavanagh “…founded the Vision Sciences Laboratory at Harvard in 1990.” Now, they are an Emeritus Professor at Harvard and Research Professor at Dartmouth.  Their work has centered on neuroscience, with specific attention to vision, cognition, and development of visual systems.  They have published in Nature, Journal of Illusion, National Academy of Sciences, and Frontiers in Neuroscience among many others. [[12]](#_ftn12) Their essay, “The artist as neuroscientist” in the March, 2005 edition of Nature has been particularly useful as an introduction to the variety of ways that artists and neuroscience can collaborate or learn from one another. 

**Jean-Pierre Changeux** – A Professor Emeritus of Neuroscience at the Institut Pasteur and an International Faculty at the Kavli Institute for Brain & Mind, University of California (San Diego), their primary research has been in neuroreceptors, but has had great influence on the intersections of Art and Neuroscience.  Changeux elaborated on this relationship in one of their many essays, “Art and Neuroscience” in the journal Leonardo, which makes a case for fostering “…further neuroscientific research in the field art criticism, such as investigations of the possible neural origins of aesthetic pleasure and artistic creation.”.[[13]](#_ftn13)

**V.S. Ramachandran** – Ramachandran is the “…Director of the Center for Brain and Cognition and Distinguished Professor with the Psychology Department and Neurosciences Program at the University of California, San Diego.”.[[14]](#_ftn14)  This researcher’s work with perception, and particularly the synesthesia phenomenon, has provided a number of interesting research findings which will aid in developing the audiovisual data relationships in the proposed aesthetic experience. 

**Sarah Schwettmann** – Schwettmann is a computational neuroscientist and one of three instructors who developed a unique course at the Center for Art, Science and Technology at MIT titled “Vision in Art and Neuroscience”.[[15]](#_ftn15) This course, and the researcher’s other works, create a network of useful information and connections in this interdisciplinary pursuit. 

**Research Design and Methods**

**A.** _A presentation of procedures in sufficient detail to support the project design._

1.     


**B.** Method of data collection and procedures proposed for data analysis, if applicable.

All data that is collected for this project will be observational and anecdotal, which aligns with aesthetic pursuits. This data will not be shared as part of the publication or exhibition process.    

**C.** _Previous experience of the individual related to the proposed project._

Much of the foundation for this proposal was built during a Fall 2019 Sabbatical. While the bulk of that work focused on creating a particular virtual reality experience, many of the skills developed created opportunities for further investigation.  Inexpensive, off the shelf, EEG BCI devices were used to test the utility of simple brainwave data in an aesthetic experience.  Those devices provided a glimpse at the potential of the data they collected, but their hardware and software environments were either too simple, or too proprietary to allow for proper investigation.  Still, this early work was shared at Washington State University and the University of Colorado – Boulder during short Visiting Artist stays in 2019 as both a virtual reality and projected experience, where the response was positive. This proposal represents the next step in that journey. 

Prior to the 2019 Sabbatical, this researcher was investigating visual patterns in data and alternative human computer interface technologies.  Patterns in GPS location data from farm animals as they moved around their enclosures were revealed by processing that data in custom java software.  Some of the resulting images from this research were still on display until December of 2021 at the Meyer Library, on the Springfield MSU campus.  This exhibition grew out of the work’s inclusion in the _TechnOzarks_, a 2019 publication from the Ozarks Studies Institute.   

**D.** A brief description of how the results of the project will be disseminated.

This project will have the potential to be submitted as research and paper proposals at conferences, festivals, and symposia in addition to the immersive experiences being submitted for inclusion in festivals and exhibitions. 

Proposals will be submitted to the national and international conferences or festivals listed below during 2023 and into 2024 once the project is ready for exhibition and publication. A proposal will also be made to include this work in Missouri State University research sharing events.  Additional opportunities may be identified in process.

**EVA London** (Electronic Visualization and the Arts)– Held annually in July, this international conference focuses on supporting new technologies within the arts and culture.  The proposal deadline for 2023’s event will be in January 2023.

**ISEA** (International Symposium on Electronic Arts) – This symposia’s goals are “…fostering interdisciplinary academic discourse and exchange among culturally diverse organisations and individuals working with art, science and technology.”[[16]](#_ftn16)

**Currents New Media** – An annual festival / exhibition, this event “…showcases interactive and non-interactive installations, multimedia performances, VR and AR environments, single channel video, animation, and experimental documentary, robotics, wearables and 3D printing.”[[17]](#_ftn17)

**Ars Electronica** – This organization, based in Linz, Austria, supports research and collaboration from artists, scientists, technologists, designers, developers, and entrepreneurs and activists from all over the world through year-round programming and the annual Ars Electronic Festival. 

**IMPAKT Festival** – The IMPAKT Centre for Media Culture in Utrecht, Netherlands holds an annual “…five-day multimedia event that includes exhibitions, film screenings, lectures, panels, performances, presentations, and artists talks…”.[[18]](#_ftn18)

**CICA New Media Art Conference** – The Czong Institute for Contemporary Art (CICA) hosts an annual conference “…to celebrate art in the digital age and share thoughts and ideas on new forms of art and culture in relation to emerging technologies and trends including artificial intelligence, virtual/augmented reality, social media, and art in the time of pandemic.”[[19]](#_ftn19)

**E.** Plans for extending the investigation beyond the immediate project.

There are currently plans to make use of the findings of this investigation in a collaboration with musician and professor Steven Pane from the University of Maine in Farmington.  A potential collaboration was forming in late 2019, early 2020, which was derailed by the rapidly emerging coronavirus pandemic.  The proposed collaboration would make use of EEG brain-computer interface to assist in creating unique visuals to accompany original compositions performed by Prof. Pane.  Conversation on this collaboration is now resuming and would be a fitting application for the findings of this proposed project.  This future collaboration would be a natural extension of the research supported by this grant. 

This research will also represent the addition of a major conceptual and technical tool capable of being used ad infinitum while evolving the potential generative relationships and artist-participant collaborations.       

**F.** Beginning and ending dates for the project.

Work on this research project will begin in earnest once funded and the proposed EEG hardware is acquired.  If immediate availability of the EEG hardware is assumed, then the projected project start date is June 2022, with the research reaching publication and exhibition readiness before or by the end of May, 2023. 

**Other Sources of Funding**

**A.**   _List any external cost-sharing funds that can be applied to this project, if any._

The proposed EEG equipment will be in high demand during the duration of the research project, which will certainly lead to similar, subsequent research opportunities.  This makes it difficult to predict cost sharing in the equipment.  Beyond using documentation equipment available in the Art + Design department there are no external cost-sharing funds identified at this time.

**Previous Faculty Grants**

2017 – Summer Faculty Fellowship – This support provided dedicated time to investigating interactive installation and data driven imagery.  I utilized motion tracking, infrared data capture, and physical computing.  This process led to natural evolutions which propelled me to use VR / AR as a medium as well as Creative Code in general.  This work led to three Visiting Artist stints, all of which are occurring during the Fall of 2019.  I also presented a paper which included findings from this research as part of a panel at the 2017 FATE (Foundations in Art: Theory and Education) Biennial Conference.  This work was exhibited in National and International venues as well.

2015 – Curriculum Innovation Grant – This grant provided support to purchase new printing equipment which has allowed for greater cross over between the Digital Art and Printmaking areas in the Art + Design Department at Missouri State University.  The equipment has had a positive impact in those areas for both student and faculty.

2014 – Faculty Research Grant – This grant was crucial in developing a body of work that helped propel me toward Tenure & Promotion.  The research supported by this grant was exhibited at seven national and international group exhibitions, as well as two solo exhibitions.  From this work I also developed papers and presentations that were included in
